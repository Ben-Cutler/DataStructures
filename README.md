# DataStructures
My CS 116 class, and other data structures projects:
The following files are :
1) infix.cpp:
A program which uses stacks and queues to evaluate arithmetic expressions like: '5+6^2*73=' by converting using reverse polish notation to solve the expression.
2) Integrals.cpp:
A program which uses both the right and left endpoint method to approximate an integral expression. Solves this many times to compute the integral within a interval 'epsilon'
3) LinkedDictionary.cpp:
Uses linked lists to compute the most common words in a text document
4) sudoku.cpp:
Inputs a 9x9 array and decides if it is a correct sudoku board or not.
5) WAR.cpp :
Uses queues to play a game of 'war' with two players.
6) trie.cpp:
Inplements a 'trie' data structure - similar to a binary tree - but it has 26 directions. Stores words
